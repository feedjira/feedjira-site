# The Feedjira Website

This project is the code for feedjira.com, if you were looking for the actual
gem, you can find that [here][gem].

[gem]: https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira

## Running locally

This site is built using [Middleman][mm], see that project for complete
documentation, but the basics are:

[mm]: http://middlemanapp.com

```
$ middleman server
```

This will start a server running at `http://localhost:4567`.

```
$ middleman build
```

This will build the site into the `build` folder.
