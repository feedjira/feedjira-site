title: Feedzirra Renamed Feedjira

Changes

* Moving to GitHub organization
* Changing the name
* New website
* 0.9 track to support Feedzirra users and help them upgrade

Should each one of these be their own post? Or maybe the post announcing the
version bump will link to pages for each thing individually?



With the release of Feedjira version 1.0, we're dropping the old Feedzirra name.
With this change comes a cool new website and a move to a GitHub organization.

When I took over maintenance last fall I knew I wanted to rename the Gem, but
the suggestion that was floated in the open GitHub issue didn't seem like the
right answer because Feedzilla is already a thing.

I thought about it for a while and realized that Feedjira was a good fit - it
kept the same Japanese pop-culture reference, but didn't have the same
possibility of offending anyone.

I'd like to take this opportunity to say that my motivation to rename the Gem
was pretty straightforward - I found myself getting embarrassed when I told
people the name of the project I was working on.

At first there was the confusion - are you saying 'Feedzilla'? No, its
'Feedzirra', like with Rs instead of Ls. Wait, what?

Then maybe people would sorta give me a look. What I read in that look was that
they thought the name was in bad taste and maybe a bit offensive.

I'm not saying Feedzirra is offensive or isn't - what I'm saying is that I don't
want to be embarrassed by the name of the project that I work on, so I decided to
change the name to something that wouldn't make me feel funny.
